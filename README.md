# CubeView 🚀

**CubeView** is a Data Observability and Metadata Intelligence platform designed to help teams monitor, understand, and trust their data systems.

It enables proactive monitoring of data quality, incident detection, metadata management, lineage tracking, and AI-assisted insights — all through a unified, production-ready dashboard.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern data systems fail silently.

* Tables stop updating
* Schemas change without notice
* Fields start returning null values
* Data volume suddenly spikes or drops
* ETL jobs fail silently

CubeView solves this by continuously monitoring your data systems and generating actionable insights before small issues become production problems.
